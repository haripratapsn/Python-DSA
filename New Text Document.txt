Data Structure in Python'

Data Structure the structure of the data in which it is stored and accessed efficiently.

A data structure is a built-in or user-defined way of organizing and storing data in Python so it can be accessed, updated, and processed efficiently. 

Implementation of Data Structure in Python 

Array -> List

Hash Table -> Dictionary

Linked List -> Not Available

Big O Notation is used to measure the space required by the program grow as input size increases.

Running Time :

The time taken to process the input and give output is running time.

Running time is the total time an algorithm takes to complete all of its operations, expressed as a function of the input size n.

for example if the size of an array is 100 and it take's 0.2 milliseconds to run
	and the if the size of a array is 1000 and it take's 2.2 milliseconds to run


the time taken to run this program is linearly proportional to the size of the array. so we can represent any linear representation as time=a*n + b.

the reason we don't use the time=a*n + b formula for the mathematical representation of because the time taken will differ as per the computer so it will not be constant result for the same program in different computer so we use some rules to represent it as a mathematical representation.

t = a*n + b

n → size of the input

a → Constant cost per input element (work done for each item).

b → Constant overhead (setup work that doesn’t depend on n)


t=a*n + b

Rule 1 :-

1. We only keep the fastest growing term

t=a*n

Rule 2 :-

1. Drop any constant numbers

t= O(n)

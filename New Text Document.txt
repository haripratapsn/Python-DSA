Data Structure in Python'

Data Structure the structure of the data in which it is stored and accessed efficiently.

A data structure is a built-in or user-defined way of organizing and storing data in Python so it can be accessed, updated, and processed efficiently. 

Implementation of Data Structure in Python 

Array -> List

Hash Table -> Dictionary

Linked List -> Not Available

Big O Notation is used to measure the space required by the program grow as input size increases.

Running Time :

The time taken to process the input and give output is running time.

Running time is the total time an algorithm takes to complete all of its operations, expressed as a function of the input size n.

for example if the size of an array is 100 and it take's 0.2 milliseconds to run
	and the if the size of a array is 1000 and it take's 2.2 milliseconds to run
